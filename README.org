* Hyper key for macOS Sierra
  Finally I can get the hyper key working on macOS Sierra. Big thanks to *@wwwjky*. Here is how I do it.

** Function
   - short click caps-lock = ESC
   - long press caps-lock = Ctrl
* Credit
  I found the solution here in this [[https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner-Elements/issues/8][issue]].

* Installation Step
  1. install Karabiner binary [[https://github.com/wwwjfy/Karabiner-Elements/releases/tag/0.90.46][HERE]]
  2. do not upgrade! here is why. This is a fork from another repository, but
     the update matches to the previous repository.
  3. install this config repository like this ~git clone
     https://github.com/shan199105/karabiner-config.git ~/.karabiner.d~
