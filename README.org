* Hyper key for macOS Sierra
  Finally I can get the hyper key working on macOS Sierra. Big thanks to *@wwwjky*. Here is how I do it.

** Function
   - short click caps-lock = ESC
   - long press caps-lock = Ctrl
* Credit
  I found the solution here in this [[https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner-Elements/issues/8][issue]].

* Installation Step
  1. install Karabiner binary [[https://github.com/wwwjfy/Karabiner-Elements/releases][HERE]]
  2. do not upgrade! here is why. This is a fork from another repository, but
     the update matches to the previous repository.
  3. install this config repository like this ~git clone
     https://github.com/nuynait/karabiner-config.git ~/.karabiner.d~

** Problem Solving
   If it does not work, try to restart the computer. See log tab, if having
   error such as ~event_manipulator not working~ try uninstall reinstall restart
   etc. If still doesn't work, install an earlier version. If still doesn't
   work, try to install 0.90.75
